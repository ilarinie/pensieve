            Review this PR against the project rules in CLAUDE.md.
            Focus on:
            - Functional style (no classes)
            - Proper dependency injection (db as first param, no singletons)
            - TSDoc on every export
            - Test coverage (co-located tests, vitest, describe/test not it)
            - Security (OWASP top 10)
            - No semicolons, single quotes
            - Import extensions (.js on relative imports)
            - const + arrow for exports
            - type not interface
            - kebab-case file names
            Post inline comments for specific issues.
            Approve if the PR follows all rules, request changes otherwise.
